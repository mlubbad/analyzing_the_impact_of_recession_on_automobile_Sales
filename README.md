Introduction
This project analyzes the historical trends in automobile sales during various recession periods. By examining various factors such as GDP, Unemployment Rate, Consumer Confidence, and more, we aim to gain insights into how recessions impacted automobile sales.

Objectives
Create informative and visually appealing plots with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Analyze data to uncover insights on the impact of recessions on automobile sales.
Understand the correlation between different economic indicators and their effect on sales.
Data Description
The dataset contains historical automobile sales data, representing sales and related variables during recession and non-recession periods. The key columns include:

Date: The date of the observation.
Recession: Indicates recession period (1 means it was a recession, 0 means it was normal).
Automobile_Sales: The number of vehicles sold.
GDP: The per capita GDP value in USD.
Unemployment_Rate: The monthly unemployment rate.
Consumer_Confidence: Represents consumer confidence.
Seasonality_Weight: Represents the seasonality effect on automobile sales.
Price: The average vehicle price.
Advertising_Expenditure: The advertising expenditure of the company.
Vehicle_Type: The type of vehicles sold.
Competition: The measure of competition in the market.
Month & Year: Extracted from Date.
Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Folium (for mapping)
Visualizations and Insights
Yearly Sales Trend: Analyzed how automobile sales fluctuated from year to year.
Sales Trend by Vehicle Type: Observed variations in sales trends between different vehicle types during recession periods.
Sales during Recession vs. Non-Recession: Compared the sales trend per vehicle type for a recession period with a non-recession period.
Effect of GDP on Sales: Examined the variations in GDP during recession and non-recession periods.
Seasonality Impact: Analyzed the effect of seasonality on automobile sales.
Correlation Analysis: Studied the correlation between consumer confidence, average vehicle price, and automobile sales during recession periods.
Advertising Expenditure Analysis: Explored how the advertising expenditure changed during recession and non-recession periods.
Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into the behavior of automobile sales during recession periods. Factors like GDP, consumer confidence, and unemployment rates significantly influence sales trends, especially during economic downturns.
