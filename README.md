## Introduction

This project analyzes the historical trends in automobile sales during various recession periods. By examining various factors such as GDP, Unemployment Rate, Consumer Confidence, and more, we aim to gain insights into how recessions impacted automobile sales.

## Objectives

- Create informative and visually appealing plots with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Dash.
- Analyze data to uncover insights on the impact of recessions on automobile sales.
- Understand the correlation between different economic indicators and their effect on sales.

## Visualizations and Insights - Part 2

- **Interactive Dashboard with Dash**: Developed a comprehensive dashboard for users to dynamically select and visualize various aspects of the data.
- **Recession vs. Yearly Data Analysis**: Users can select between analyzing data for recession periods or yearly sales statistics.
- **Year Selection for Analysis**: Enhanced the dashboard to allow users to select a specific year and gather insights from the data of that year.
- **Detailed Recession Analysis**: The dashboard provides visualizations such as line charts, bar graphs, and pie charts, offering insights into the automobile sales trend, average number of vehicles sold by type, expenditure share by vehicle type, and the effect of unemployment during recessions.
- **Yearly Sales Analysis**: Similar to the recession analysis but focuses on data from a selected year, allowing users to see trends and patterns specific to that year.
